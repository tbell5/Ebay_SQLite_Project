# about
This project, originally completed for UW class CS564--Database Management Systems, is meant to demonstrate basic proficiency in building/querying SQL relations. In it, we formed an SQL database for Ebay auctions data, which was initially provided by a JSON file dump. We then wrote a series of SQLite queries to test and examine the data. 

Tools/techniques used in this Project:
- **JSON**; JSON file format and Python JSON library
- **Python**; for parsing the JSON data into .dat files
- **.dat**; file format used for bridge between JSON and SQL
- **Bulk loading**; used to transform .dat files to SQLite database
- **SQLite**; database management system used for storing/querying database
- **Bash**; scripting language used to easily build the database
